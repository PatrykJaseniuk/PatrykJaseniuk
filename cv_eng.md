## About Me üë®‚Äçüíª
I enjoy working with computers using ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) and ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB). Currently, I'm focusing on developing web applications, especially user interfaces.

![Three.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/three.js-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=three.js&logoColor=white)

A 2D simulator/game written in TypeScript. Users can control a ship by adjusting sail and rudder parameters using their mouse. The simulator showcases the essence of sailing ship operation, allowing users to trim, tack, jibe, sail with the wind, and beat against it. The entire ship is constructed from molecules connected by "springs" (soft body dynamics).

## Skills üí™

### Programming Languages üíª
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)
![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)

- **TypeScript** - Currently, my favorite programming language. I value the ease of running applications on various devices (just a web browser or Node). I avoid JavaScript due to the lack of typing. I aim to write code in a functional style, using constants, as it's easier to understand (no side effects in functions).
- **C/C++** - The first language I learned. I liked it until I discovered how convenient it is to work with functions in TS/JS (first-class citizens). C++ provides more control (no garbage collector).
- **Java** - The second language I learned, and I developed my object-oriented programming concepts with it.
- **C#** - Similar to Java.
- **Python** - I used it for Raspberry Pi and some computer vision projects. It's similar to JS (lacks typing, first-class functions), but I didn't like the use of tabulation instead of curly braces.
- **PHP** - Not my favorite.

### Frameworks/Libraries üìö
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=next.js&logoColor=white)
![Jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/-jest-%23C21325?style=for-the-badge&logo=jest&logoColor=white)
![Prisma](https://img.shields.io/badge/-prisma-%232D3748?style=for-the-badge&logo=prisma&logoColor=white)

- **React** - After learning React, I fell in love with creating user interfaces.
- **Next.js** - A convenient framework/tool for building TS+React applications.
- **Jest** - I try to cover as much code as possible with tests.
- **Prisma** - fully typed ORM.

### Tools üõ†
![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)
![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)
![Linux Mint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux%20Mint-87CF3E?style=for-the-badge&logo=Linux%20Mint&logoColor=white)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)

- **Git** - I use it for version control of projects I work on independently. For each new feature, I create a new branch and merge it into the main branch upon completion. I try to name commits according to `conventional commits`.
- **Visual Studio Code** - It's my favorite IDE. I appreciate its simplicity and versatility (a vast number of extensions).
- **Linux** - An open-source operating system that provides greater control over hardware.
- **Docker** - light virtual environments.


### data bases üóÉ
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgresql-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![Supabase](https://img.shields.io/badge/supabase-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=supabase&logoColor=white)

- **Supabase**- actually I developing project using it as backend. Appreciate typed orm. 


### Natural Languages üåê
- **English** - B2.
- **Polish** - Native.
